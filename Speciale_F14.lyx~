Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With a case study of the Danish tax on saturated fats, this paper investigates
 the practices and possibilities of paternalism with particular focus on
 the com-plexities that member states of the European Union face when implementi
ng paternalistic policies.
 The paper begins by defining the different forms of pa-ternalism, before
 it moves on to a brief literature review of the literature that deals with
 paternalism both in a broader sense and in the narrower sense that implementing
 excise duties.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This paper will provide an overview of the issues regarding situations in
 which government attempts at altering the behaviour of individuals.
 The purpose of these measures might be (in approximate order of level of
 intrusion and not exhaustive) preventing some individuals harming others,
 preventing individu-als harming themselves, solving collective action problems,
 helping improve private decision-making.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Road pricing is not a paternalistic policy because it does not aim at changing
 the individual’s behaviour primarily for its own sake, but primarily because
 collective action problems.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Initially, this paper will outline the different forms and understanding
 of regu-latory paternalism along with the different types of instruments
 that can be implemented when using paternalistic policies.
 This paper will be compromised of four analyses of the idea of regulatory
 pa-ternalism: One focusing on the legal aspects; one focuses on the politics
 of regulatory paternalism; one focusing on the economics of regulatory
 paternal-ism; and one dealing with the psychology behind the ideas of regulator
y pater-nalism.
 This division of the analysis also aims at demonstrating that exploring
 such broad issues as regulation requires incorporating a cross-disciplinary
 ap-proach in order to fully grasp the complexities of regulatory issues.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative structure could be to drop the headings of psychology, politics
 etc.
 and replace them with headings that firstly individate how paternalism
 is defined, in which circumstances it might be justified, examples of paternali
sm, and the possibility of paternalism.
 How are the different concepts deployed in this paper? Every undertaking
 that relies on conveying information through words has to be painstakingly
 careful to ensure that the way in which words and concepts are deployed
 is transparent and clear.
 If not, the writer risks losing the reader in the conceptual confusion
 that might ensue.
 Thus, in the following section contains some notes on some of the concepts
 that are used interchangeably in this paper.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, regulatory paternalism, paternalistic policies, paternalistic regulatio
n, libertarian paternalism, behavioural regulation are all used interchangeably
 to denote the idea of regulatory policies that aims at improving societal
 welfare.

A paternalist can either be a person advocating different paternalist policies
 or a person who acts paternalistically towards another individual.
 It is more likely that the latter falls under the former category rather
 than vice versa, wherefore the two meanings are not completely synonymous.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Definition of paternalism and the different forms of paternalism.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Paternalistic regulation can simply be understood as a subset of certain
 regula-tory policies that to some degree attempts to influence the behaviour
 of other people (see further definitions below).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Etymologically, paternalism implies that someone acts like a father towards
 his children.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Paternalism broadly understood relates to the perennial problem of how far
 the government ought to intervene in the lives of its citizens.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thus paternalism is linked to regulatory issues of how the government can
 influence the behaviour of its citizens.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Behind the ideas of paternalism lie some fundamental questions such as:
 Do people always act in ways, which are optimal in accordance with their
 own standards? Ought the government to intervene in situations where this
 is not the case? If yes, what are the justifications of this intervention.
 This last ques-tion will be dealt with in the section devoted to a discussion
 of the different arguments for and against the justification of paternalism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
What are the limits of government intervention in preventing competent indi-vidu
als harming themselves? A classical case of this kind is the case Wacken-heim
 v France in which Mr Wackenheim disputed the prohibition of the activity
 of ‘dwarf tossing” claiming that the prohibition had adverse effect on
 his life and represented an affront to his dignity, since human dignity
 consists in hav-ing a job (Mr Wackenheim himself being a dwarf) (Szerletics,
 2011).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
New (1999) argues that it is not paternalism when the state corrects market
 failures such as correcting externalities or countering instances of imperfect
 information.
 In practice however it would at best be difficult be make this distinction
 and at worst divert attention away from the central issues to dis-cussions
 of whether we indeed are experiencing an instance of paternalism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a section outlining different definitions of paternalism it seems pertinent
 to reflect on the value of this exercise.
 Naturally, as proposed in the beginning, when relying on the medium of
 words to exchange information, one has the obligation to ensure that the
 writer helps the reader by carefully defining how the different words are
 deployed.
 Nonetheless, the flipside, at least in the case of paternalism, is that
 the definitions has the effect of moving the discussion away from the observed
 phenomenon to a discussion of whether a certain definition accurately captures
 the phenomenon.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In this regard, Haybron and Alexandrova (2013) adopts a broad definition
 of paternalism as they argue that some authors operate with such a narrow
 defi-nition of paternalism that “the charges won’t stick.”
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
At a very fundamental level Dworkin (2010) proposes to define paternalism
 by three conditions.
 Firstly, that the proposed measure or regulation somehow limits or interferes
 with the liberty or autonomy of a given individual that is affected by
 the measure.
 Secondly, that the government introduces the meas-ure without the consent
 of the individual.
 Thirdly and finally, that the gov-ernment introduces the measure only with
 a view to improving the welfare of the individual.
 We thus have a situation in which the government introduces some measure
 that limits the autonomy of some individual in order to im-prove the welfare
 of said individual.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
An alternative defition of paternalism is provided by Haybron and Alexanddrova
 (2013) who have modified Seana Shiffrin’s definition of pater-nalism proposing
 to define it as a) aimed to have (or to avoid) an effect on B or her sphere
 of legitimate agency b) that involves the (partial) substitution of some
 other entity’s judgment or agency for B’s c) done (or omitted) for the
 sake of B’s own interests or matters that le-gitimately lie within B’s
 control d) manifesting a non-deferential attitude to B’s judgment or agency
 with respect to those interests or matters.
 The above definition of paternalism is a very precise definition, which
 on the one hand risks excluding cases that are still a matter of … I have
 made a cor-rection to b).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Libertarian paternalism refers to the idea that individual choice should
 be un-hindered and that paternalistic policies should only nudge people
 in the right direction without limiting the freedom that people have to
 make non-coercive and non-mandatory choices (see for instance Sunstein
 2013).
 Other names for the same idea are “soft paternalism” or “asymmetric paternalism
”.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Others have argued that the concept of libertarian paternalism is at best
 an oxymoron and that we need to distinguish fundamentally between policies
 that respect and policies that violates individual autonomy (Economist
 2013).
 This view rests on the notion that paternalism “has to do with making people
 go in a direction they don't want to go.” Furthermore, it is understood,
 from this point of view, that paternalism is about restricting choices,
 which precludes the possibility of merging it with the adjective of “libertaria
n”.
 Based on these arguments the article concludes that “libertarian paternalism”
 is nothing but a superfluous synonym for anti-paternalism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Sunstein and Thaler (2003) counter the argument that libertarian paternalism
 is an oxymoron by arguing that paternalism understood as influencing the
 choices of people cannot be avoided because choices are always made in
 the context of something, which we also call the “choice architecture.”
 Accepting this premise and taking responsibility for the insight that people
 do not make decisions in a vacuum, policy-makers now have the choice of
 ignoring this insight or act upon it.
 If they chose to act and they do so in a welfare-enhancing and choice-preservin
g, then this is what we can call libertarian pa-ternalism, because it is
 both welfare-improving and autonomy-preserving.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Paternalism is impossible to avoid, because governments make decisions that
 affect people one way or another (Sunstein and Thaler, 2003: 1166).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This however become blurred when policy-makers try to influence the choice
 architecture by limiting the choices available to the individual, because
 then the extent of choice preservation and implicitly the respect for autonomy
 is decreased (own observation, may need further development).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This notion of paternalism is opposed to “hard paternalism” or “coercive
 pa-ternalism” whereby people in some form or another are forced to conform
 to certain religious or moralistic notions of goodness (Whitman 2010) or,
 per-haps more mainstream and modern understanding, that hard paternalism
 are for instance tax rates or bans (Glaeser 2006).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Moreover, the distinction between soft and hard paternalism can also be
 illus-trated with a situation in which one person tries to cross a bridge
 that will col-lapse and kill the person if the individual attempts at crossing
 the bridge.
 An-other person stands between the first individual and the bridge, but
 the two individuals do not speak the same language.
 Soft paternalism only justifies constraining the first individual trying
 to cross the bridge in order to deter-mine whether or not the first individual
 voluntarily attempts suicide.
 Soft pa-ternalism is when we use force to prevent someone from doing something
 in order to ascertain that the invidial acts voluntarily and knowledgeable,
 i.e.
 to obtain information in order to decide whether the individual knows the
 true consequences of his or her actions.
 Hard paternalism would be when the se-cond individual constraints the first
 individual no matter what, i.e.
 entails that the state is entitled to prevent voluntary suicide or any
 form of self-harm (Dworkin 2010).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Haybron and Alexandrova (2013) rightly point out that libetarian paternalism
 can become hard paternalism if the goals advanced are not identital to
 those of the agent affected by the policy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One can also distinguish between broad and narrow paternalism, where nar-row
 paternalism is only concerned with state coercion, while broad paternal-ism
 refers to any situation in which an institution or individual acts paternalis-t
ically against an individual (Dworkin 2010).
 In this paper we are only con-cerned with broad paternalism, so where only
 paternalism is mentioned the reader can generally assume that we mean broad
 paternalism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A further distinction is between weak and strong paternalism.
 Weak paternal-ism is the interference with the means that individuals chose
 if they the means are not suitable to meet the ends.
 If individuals value safety when driving, but choose not to wear seatbelts,
 then a weak paternalistic policy would force people to wear seatbelts.
 Strong paternalism is when individuals are con-strained in their choices
 because of a possible confusion of ends (Dworkin 2010).
 This distinction concerns the justifications for paternalism.
 When a measure interferes with the actions that are used as a means to
 an end and these means are not appropriate, the measure is an example of
 weak paternal-ism.
 When a measure interferes with an action that are means to an irrational
 end such as driving on a motorbike without a helmet because the individual
 have a preference for wind in the hair, the measure is an example of hard
 pa-ternalism.
 The end result is in both cases that seatbelts or helmets are made mandatory,
 but the justification is different.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We may also talk of impure paternalism in cases where the class of people
 that are affected by a paternalistic policy is not identical to the group
 of people whose welfare the policy is meant to improve.
 Conversely, pure paternalism is when the group of affected people are identical
 to the group whose autonomy is limited (Dworkin 2010).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A final distinction can be made between moral and welfare paternalism (Dworkin
 2010).
 Moral paternalism refers to a situation in which individuals are restrained
 from undertaking certain activities if the moral welfare of the person
 in question is in danger.
 Drawing a link to our previous example of dwarf tossing, a prohibition
 of this activity justified on the grounds that it is detrimental to the
 moral welfare of the dwarfs, would be an example of moral paternalism.
 Another example would be the prohibition of prostitution on moral grounds.

\begin_layout Section
Discussion of the justification of paternalism / normative issues of paternalism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Paternalism is justified to the extent that a) people’s choices might not
 pro-mote their own welfare and b) the government has some sort of warrant
 to interfere the actions of the people.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
How good are people to make choices for themselves? Glaeser (2006) vs.
 Sun-stein and Thaler (2003).Yes, people have better incentives to minimis
 errors in decision-making, but in actual life, they do not make optimal
 decisions for themselves.
 The fact the general public knowledge is found wanting in many people (why
 is this a good, let alone, pertinent measure for rationality or whatnot?),
 supports precisely the proposition that people do not have all the knowledge
 required to make informed choices.
 Whether or not they vote “wrongly” does not matter, if the paternalistic
 policy is constructed such as the Danish fat tax that merely aims at taxing
 the externalities that arise when con-suming unhealthy foods.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Justifications for paternalistic policies can be consequentialist or contractual
ist (Szerletics 2011).
 A consequentialist justification for a given paternalist policy would be
 that, overall, more good than harm is produced, while a contractual-ist
 justification would be that everyone could agree that the interference
 in the autonomy of an individual is justified.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Thompson (1987; as cited in Sunstein and Thaler, 2003) lists the following
 three criteria that justifies paternalism: impaired judgment, temporary
 and re-versible intervention, and prevention of serious and irreversible
 harm.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Government intervention justified because of the presence of externalities:
 Pigou.
 This idea is developed further in the section on the economics of pa-ternalism.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Paternalism goes further than simply correcting externalities.
 Sunstein and Thaler (2003, 1162) presents the proposition that paternalism
 also involves situation in which “it is legitimate for private and public
 institutions to attempt to influence people’s behavior even when third-pary
 effects are absent.” It should in this regard however be noted that in societies
 where health care is publicly provided, all forms of paternalistic policies
 aiming to influence behav-iour that have adverse health consequences do
 also have third-party effects in that the bill is shouldered by other tax
 payers.
 In cases such as default enrol-ment in pension plans, where the alternative
 is not necessarily funded by pub-lic funds, then it makes sense to point
 out that attempts at influencing behav-iour is not justified in regard
 to other people, but only to one’s future self.
 This then begs the question of whether a paternalistic policy is better
 justified with reference to other people than to oneself.
 J.S.
 Mill argued that paternal-istic interventions are only justifiable if they
 are used to prevent harm to oth-ers, never to oneself; everyone is allowed
 to commit suidice.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under which conditions is paternalism justified, if ever? Human beings are
 not rational and often discount the future more than is warranted.
 They do not save enough or consume more of certain goods that gives immediate
 gratifica-tion, while pose health problems in the long-run.
 Moreover, people are found to be unrealistically optimistic (Sunstein 2013).

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another similar discussion is whether choices are always aligned with true
 preferences (Verdelin 2007).
 Say for instance that a patient is told either 1) that 10% of the people
 undergoing a medical procedure does not survive, or 2) that 90% does survive
 (Sunstein and Thaler 2003).
 Assuming that when hear-ing option 2) the patient has a preference for
 undergoing the medical proce-dure, while the opposite is the case when
 presented with option 1).
 In this case there seems to be no “true preferences” that are unaffected
 by the way in which the choices are presented, which makes the very notion
 that choices are always aligned with true preferences fruitless to pursue.

\begin_layout Standard
“Economists will and should be ignored if we continue to insist that it
 is axi-omatic that constantly trading stocks or accumulating consumer debt
 or be-coming a heroin addict must be optimal for the people doing these
 things merely because they have chosen to do it.” (O’Donoghue and Rabin
 2003).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Preferences might change as a result of consumption (Sunstein and Thaler
 2003, 1165).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Based on an assumption that existing justifications of paternalism have
 been inadequate in explaining why the state should be more successful than
 the individual in promoting individual’s welfare, New (1999) have outlined
 several explanations for why this may be the case.
 The argument is that the state in several situations is better placed to
 make an optimal decision than the indi-vidual.
 This argument runs somewhat counter to the arguments of Glaeser in his
 article in Regulation.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Economics of paternalism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Very often the price mechanism is the optimal way in which to decide how
 the resources of society are allocated.
 The price and quantity of the goods in the economy are determined by the
 interplay of supply and demand of consumers and producers.
 However, at times the market fails to efficiently allocate re-sources,
 in which case we talk of market failures.
 A number of such have been identified, but the most important for this
 paper is that of externalities.
 The concept of externalities refers to a situation in which the private
 and social costs of a given good do not coincide.
 The future health costs inflicted on the health care system are not included
 in the private, i.e.
 retail price of, say, a cig-arette.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main argument for the role of government intervention in the relevant
 markets is that the price may not reflect the true social cost of the consump-t
ion of certain goods.
 This idea stems from the 20th-century English econo-mist Arthur Pigou,
 why we can call such externality correcting taxes for Pigouvian taxes.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
From a classical economic efficiency perspective, it makes sense to counter
 market failures because the presence of a market failure implies that we
 do not have a situation of optimal resource allocation in the economy,
 and the re-sources that we have are not put to their most efficient usage.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The Public Choice, however, argues that market failures do not necessarily
 warrant government intervention as the cost of government failure may be
 higher than the cost of market failure.

 Arguments against paternalism; sceptics of paternalism; private vs.

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Glaeser (2006) presents a number of arguments for limiting the use of pater-nali
sm.
 He argues that decision-making generally is better in situations where
 the incentives to be correct are stronger.
 Thus, if incentives are stronger at the private level, decisions are better
 taken here.
 Moreover, he argues that the incentives are weaker at the governmental
 level, so that the government will be less likely than private individuals
 to expend effort to correct errors.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In a similar vein, he argues that governmental decision-making “increases
 wel-fare if and only if the probability that the government knows the true
 cost of smoking greater than the probability that the individuals know
 the true cost.” One the face of it, this argument sounds valid, but even
 though the true cost is known by either or both of the parties, the presence
 of inter alia self-control problems in the consumption of, say, cigarettes
 suggests that insufficient in-formation is not the only cause a market
 failure in this area.
 Government deci-sion-making make thus also increase welfare if changes,
 say, the choice archi-tecture of cigarette consumption, again even though
 individuals know the true cost of smoking better that than the government.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As likely as individuals are to commit mistakes in their decision-making
 on their consumption, as likely are they to commit errors in their voting
 behav-iour.
 The obvious conclusion from this proposition is to question the degree
 to which the elected politicians are capable of correcting errors better
 than the individuals that elected them.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Glaeser (2006) equates the deficiency in basic public knowledge with the
 like-lihood of making errors in voting.
 This however begs the question of one can vote erroneously, and who is,
 ultimately, to decide whether a given individual has voted “wrongly”? In
 addition, if one assumes that it indeed is possible to commit errors in
 voting, the connection between a lack of basic public knowledge and the
 degree to which one is likely to make error in voting is not obvious.
 Is there a linear relationship between the two? And can the errors committed
 in voting be measured on a continuous scale or is it a binomial variable?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The “double-dividend hypothesis” suggests that taxing polluting production
 has two positive effects, namely a reduction in pollution and an improvement
 in economic efficiency as far as the revenue from the environmental tax
 is used to reduce other taxes that might have a distortionary effect on
 labour supply or savings decisions (Fullerton and Metcalf, 1997).
 This thinking can be generalised to other forms of behavioural regulation
 such as the fat tax.
 How-ever, the second part of the dividend, i.e.
 that other distortionary taxes are reduced, are only realised if the revenue
 from the tax is indeed used to de-crease other taxes.
 Often the revenue from environmental taxes are not ear-marked to specific
 purposes, but used to fill a hole in the general state budget.
 Where precisely the money goes is in other words hard to determine.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Haybron and Alexandrova (2013) have persuasively argued that minimalist
 cost-benefit analysis in economics in its refusal to take into account
 anything else than revealed preferences often inadvertently prescribes
 measures of hard paternalism, because it fails to account for underlying
 values that might not necessarily be aligned with the revealed preferences.
 They dub this type of paternalism for inattentive paternalism and illuminates
 the concept with the analogy of a better-mening sibling that in its eagerness
 to help the younger sibling fails to realise what the younger sibling really
 wants, “Of course they’re better off!”.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
While economic analysis can provide some of the arguments that can either
 be used to justify or undermine the justifications for paternalism, the
 analysis of the practical possibilities of paternalistic policies in a
 liberal democracy lie within the scope of political science, which we in
 this case may dub the sci-ence of the politically possible.

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that the ultimate objective of every government is to maximize
 so-cietal welfare, taxation plays the role of shifting the economic incentives
 to-wards consumer choices that are better not necessarily only for the
 individual consumer, but also for the rest of the society if for example
 the consumption entails externalities.
 The notion that taxation shifts economic incentives im-plies that taxation
 affects private behaviour (Schön 1999).
 The degree to which this is in fact the case depends on the degree to which
 private individu-als respond to price changes, which in economic terminology
 is described by the concept of the price elasticity of demand or simply
 elasticity.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
One form of implementing paternalistic policies is thus to impose excise
 du-ties or consumption taxes on goods, whose consumption somehow involves
 an externality.
 Prime examples in this vein are the excise duties on tobacco and alcohol.
 Specifically, there have been attempts at deriving the optimal lev-els
 of sin taxes (O’Donoghue and Rabin).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Relying on excise duties implies however a paradox in relation to the rationali-
ty assumptions.
 On the one hand, one of the arguments for imposing an ex-cise duty is that
 consumers discount the future health problems of for instance smoking or
 the presence of self-control problems caused by the addictive na-ture of
 tobacco.
 There is in other words some form of irrationality in the de-terminants
 of the demand of consumption of cigarettes.
 On the other hand, imposing a tax on tobacco products assumes that consumers
 rationally change their consumption patterns as a result of higher prices.
 Given the addictive nature of tobacco, it is thus likely that consumption
 will not decrease if prices are only increased marginally as the result
 of an excise duty.
 This is where more subtle forms of regulation can enter the picture, namely
 the cue regula-tion in the form of banning advertisements for tobacco products
 (Verdelin 2007) or introducing plain packaging (Alemmano 2012b).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Indeed, Frey (2005, 230-3) argues that “excise taxation under identifiable
 con-ditions leads to undesired and even counterproductive outcomes” and
 outlines five problems in the standard theory of excise taxation that are
 worth men-tioning here in their entirety.
 Firstly, excise taxes do only lead to a socially im-proved resource allocation
 if the externalities are substantial.
 Moreover, other approaches besides taxation may be more effective in reducing
 externalities.
 Secondly, when the price of one good increases as a result of the imposition
 of an excise duty, the relative price of substitute good falls.
 Examples of this are that increasing the price of alcohol increases the
 consumption of marijuana, or that increasing the price of goods containing
 high amounts of saturated fats increases the consumption of other equally
 unhealthy (processed) foods.
 Thirdly, the classical trade-off between equity and allocative efficiency
 is also at play when using excise taxation to correct market failures such
 as externali-ties.
 There is in other words a regressive income effect as consumers with lower
 incomes use a higher proportion of their income on these goods or that
 they are less able to find a substitute good.
 Fourthly, one should take into ac-count that taxation most probably entails
 that some individuals will weigh the risk of being caught along with the
 size of the penalty against the gains of evading the tax, i.e.
 as Frey writes, “taxation leads to tax evation.” In addition, at a certain
 point the existence of excise duties may create an incentive for organized
 crime to establish an elaborate black or grey market for the dutiable goods,
 which, when first in place, is difficult to dismantle with subsequent reduction
s in the duty rate.
 Fifthly and finally, excise taxation entails an often not insignificant
 amount of administrative costs.

One of the fundamental concepts in the field is that of choice architecture
 (Sunstein 2013).
 The idea is that people do not make decisions in a vacuum; they are influenced
 by an ample range of factors, and one of them is the struc-ture or architecture
 of the choices that are presented to the decision-maker.
 If this structure can be changed such that the “better” choices are the
 default choices, people still have the choice to opt for something else,
 but they will with a reasonably high probability chose the default option.
 An example of this can be automatic enrolment in a pension plan as opposed
 to a system where you actively have to enrol yourself (Sunstein and Thaler
 2003).
 Another example is to present healthier foods in a prime location in a
 cafeteria.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Other possibilities include changing the choice architecture (outlined else-wher
e) for instancing by regulating cues (advertisements) or visual displays
 on the products.
 Using these measures does away with the need for relying on assumptions
 of rationality of actors in designing the optimal instrument.
 (A new paradigm is emerging… Alemanno (2012b)).

One method of decreasing the likelihood of traffic accidents is to install
 mechanisms in cars, so that they can only be started if the driver does
 not have more alcohol in the blood than over a certain threshold.
 In this way, the people who have been drinking cannot simply start their
 cars (at least without getting a sober friend to blow into the mechanism).
 In relation to the discus-sions of the possible justifications for paternalism,
 this can be seen as an in-stance of limiting harm to others, as drunk driving
 not only harms the driver, but has the potential to harm others.
 In this way the objections to this form of regulation should be limited
 if judged according to the libertarian standard of Mill.

\begin_layout Section
Rationality
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If one assumes that humans are fully rational, the government should be
 con-cerned with correcting externalities.
 Thus departing from this assumption, it is now necessary to model the different
 effects on consumption that irrational behaviour causes.
 One such influence are cue shocks that affect the marginal utility of consumpti
on in a stochastic sense (Verdelin 2007).
 Others can be inconsistent intertemporal resource allocation on any form,
 or self-control problems as modelled by O’Donoghue and Rabin.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
When dissecting the assumption of rationality one realises that it is important
 to define what is actually meant with rationality.
 A rational individual is sup-posed to reduce consumption when prices rise,
 able to make “correct” choices … The concept of rationality is vague.
 What is rational thinking? Making de-liberate choices, making choices that
 are truly aligned with ones preferences, not letting irrational factors
 such as feelings interfere with thinking and deci-sion-making.
 Example of Amartya Sen with two strangers meeting.
 Rational choice theory, public choice theory…
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Is rationality a binomial concept, i.e.
 a person or a decision is either rational or irrational, or is it a discrete
 concept with several well-defined ordinal stages of rationality, or indeed
 a continous concept where any decision can be placed on a spectrum that
 bounds from infinitely irrational to infinitely rational? In other words,
 are rationality and irrationality mutually exclusive?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Incorporating irrationality into the models of optimal taxation can cause
 the policy prescriptions to alter quite fundamentally.
 Indeed, Verdelin (2007) has confirmed that the degree of optimal paternalism
 depends on the modelling assumptions in a study that inter alia concludes
 that regulation of visceral cues that affect consumption such as advertising
 and sin taxes are substitutable regulatory instruments.
 Cues cause conditioned responses that anticipate con-sumption or increase
 the demand for a certain good.
 With goods that are ad-dictive or cause a release of dopamine, regulation
 of such cues can be instru-mental in curbing consumption of these goods
 on par with the imposition of excise duties.
 Naturally, we talk about goods whose consumption entails some sort of externali
ty that is not accounted for in the private cost.

Psychology of paternalism
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Some aspects of what we can call the psychology of paternalism is related
 to psychological issues in the political decision-making process, while
 others re-late more to the private decision-making, cf.
 the arguments of Glaeser (2006).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Interestingly, although the price system is shown to be relatively efficient
 in allocating the resources in a given economy, studies suggest that people
 do not see the price system as ‘fair’.
 Tellingly, the only other allocation system seen as less fair than the
 price system is random allocation (Frey, 235).
 The upshot of this finding is that if people in the first place do not
 perceive the price system as the best way of allocating a society’s resources,
 then the remedies for cor-recting failures in this price system have even
 less legitimacy.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Another finding of interest is that people are more likely to accept un
 unfa-vourable outcome if they perceive the process leading up to the outcome
 as fair (Frey, 235).
 This finding is of interest when looking at the political feasibil-ity
 of imposing paternalistic policies.
 If some sort of paternalistic policy is to be implemented that harm certain
 societal groups, it is important that politi-cians and other relevant decision-
makers ensure to the highest possible degree that the legislative process
 is open and accountable such that the groups that are adversely affected
 by the measure at least have the perception that the pro-cess is fair albeit
 the measure is not perceived thus.
 Morever, these “results underscore the importance of using the democratic
 decision-making process instead of a technocratic approach” (Frey 2005,
 235).
 In relation to this find-ing, Haybron and Alexandrova (2013, 177) argue
 that one of the consequences of the doctrine of minimal cost-benefit analysis
 that underscores many policy choices is that economics has a bad name among
 “ordinary” citizens, because they have a feeling that no one is listening
 to them.
 This happens because the minimalism branch of economics disregard other
 forms of preferences or values except what are observable.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Paternalistic policies that hit a small group of people and benefit a larger
 group of people are generally more politically viable than measures that
 affect a broad group of people, while only benefitting a few.
 This proposition may help explain why it is easier to justify and implement
 excise duties on ciga-rettes and gambling, while it is harder to implement
 environmental taxes and road pricing (Frey 2005, 239).
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Besides the societal aspects of the psychology of paternalism outlined above
 that pertains to the importance of the perceived fairness of the price
 system and the procedures of public decision-making, there is a number
 of findings that indicate deficiencies in private decision-making that
 possibly warrants paternalistic policies.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Firstly, we have the proposition that people possess insufficient will-power
 to act according to their true preferences in areas such as gambling, drinking
 and smoking (Frey 2005, 236).
 Furthermore, an assumption of insufficient will-power implies that people
 make time-inconsistent choices.
 Addiction is a spe-cial case of weakness of will, because the momentaneous
 need to get the need fulfilled overrules the longer-term desire to limit
 the consumption of, say, to-bacco.
 Paternalistic policies might thus limit the social and private responsibil-ity
 of individuals engaging in behaviour that somehow warrants government intervent
ion.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Under certain conditions true preferences might not exist (Sunstein and
 Tha-ler, 2003: 1164).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Revealed preferences do not necessarily equate true preferences.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
‘Rational addiction’ arguments from Frey, link to section on rationality.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Excise taxes influence behaviour systematically, albeit at times ineffectively.
 For instance, the marginal effect on an excise duty increase has been shown
 to be quite small for inter alia cigarettes and alcohol (Frey 236).
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Excise duties may have the side effect of crowding out intrinsic motivation
 by providing external rewards (Frey 2005, 238).
 This idea has also been referred to as ‘the hidden costs of rewards’.
 If citizens are treated like children, there is a danger that they will
 not emerge from this imposed immaturity taking re-sponsibility for their
 actions (Szerletics 2011).
 Moreover, the existence of an excise duty on a ‘sin good’ may act as a
 ‘licence to do’.
 The rational individual can now justify his or her consumption of the particula
r good with the fact that whatever social cost not included in the private
 price, i.e.
 without taxes, is not included, which makes the consumption of the particular
 good ‘rational’.
 Also example of road pricing.

This paper is not concerned with deriving the optimal level of taxation.
 Such efforts abound elsewhere.
 Nygård (2010) have for instance looked at the op-timal excise duty in cases
 of cross-border shopping and illegal import both of which increase the
 price elasticity of demand.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Many results within the literature on optimal (sin) taxation hinges on the
 de-gree to which human beings can be seen as rational actors.
 Thus, if the ration-ality assumption does not hold, the derived level of
 optimal taxation may in-deed not be optimal.
 This points to a more general problem optimising utility functions…

 Politics of paternalism; general introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Economist might agree that broadly based taxes applied according to the
 Ramsey rule (tax inversely proportionate to elasticity) are superior ceteris
 pari-bus.
 Enter politics and the picture looks radically different; everything else
 is no longer equal, in fact, it is no longer possible to hold other factors
 that might affect the result constant, which opens up for political deliberatio
n and negotiation.
 The optimal level of taxation that is feasible under the current political
 conditions might thus be very different from the optimal level derived
 under the assumptions of the economists.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Assuming that politicians are partly motivated by the desire of being re-elected
 (“partly” because we also want to allow for more altruistic and magnanimous
 motives), they are interested in financing “government expenditures with
 as little popular resistance as possible” (Frey, 233).
 Imposing broad based excise duties or other paternalistic policies oppose
 this objective quite strongly.
 It is often more politically viable to impose the costs of a given policy
 on a limited number of voters, while spreading out the benefits as far
 as possible.
 Hence, imposing excise duties on cigarettes are easier to implement because
 they only hit a specific group of voters than say a tax on foods containing
 high amounts of saturated fats, because many more buy butter.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Politicians are also interested in ensuring that the possible success of
 a meas-ure is easily attributed to themselves, while ensuring the possibility
 of disasso-ciating themselves from a possible failure.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The government has an incentive to restrain substitution possibilities in
 order to reduce the price elasticity of demand and the consequent revenue
 (Frey, 234).
 For instance, when imposing a congestion charge, government revenue increases
 as the difficulty of using public transporation increases.
 This reason-ing however assumes that the ultimate purpose of any government
 is to raise revenue and that it is not concerned with the well-being of
 its citizens, so alt-hough that it is clear that the incentive exists,
 it is not a persuasive argument that governments indeed act in this way.
